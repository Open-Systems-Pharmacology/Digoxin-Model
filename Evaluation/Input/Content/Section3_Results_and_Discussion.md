The PBPK model for digoxin was developed with clinical pharmacokinetic data covering intravenous as well as oral administration with a dose range of 0.125 to 1.5 mg including single dose and multiple dose clinical data, for different types of tablet formulations.

During the model-fitting, the following parameters were estimated (all other parameters were fixed to reported values):

* Lipophilicity
* ATP1A2 Dissociation constant (Kd)
* P-gp catalytic rate constant (Kcat)
* Hepatic Clearance (CLhep)
* Specific intestinal permeability (transcellular)
* Specific organ permeability 

The fit resulted in an adequate description of the clinical data. Additional implementation of transport by OATP (4C1) did not improve the model performance and was not used in the final model.
