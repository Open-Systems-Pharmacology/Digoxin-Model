The presented model building and evaluation report evaluates the performance of a PBPK model for digoxin in adults.

Digoxin is a cardiac glycoside used to treat atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter and heart failure.
Digoxin is transported by P-glycoprotein 1 (P-gp), also known as multidrug resistance protein 1 (MDR1) or ATP-binding cassette sub-family B member 1 (ABCB1) or cluster of differentiation 243 (CD243) poly-glycoprotein. P-gp and mainly excreted unchanged via the kidneys with a small fraction eliminated via biliary excretion and only a very low degree of hepatic metabolism  ([Greiner 1999, Ochs 1878 ](#References)).
Many other substrates of P-gp are metabolized by CYP3A4, setting digoxin apart as an
exception and thereby turning it into a model victim drug of P-gp-mediated DDIs.

Digoxin is reported to have a large volume of distribution due to extensive tissue binding and to be mainly excreted unchanged to urine (50 - 70%) while the remainder of a dose is eliminated by hepatic metabolism and biliary excretion ([Ochs 1878, Bauer 2008](#References))]. The final digoxin model applies target-binding, transport by P-gp in various organs including gut, liver and kidney, an unspecific hepatic metabolic clearance and glomerular filtration, and adequately described the pharmacokinetics of digoxin in adults.

The digoxin model is a whole-body PBPK model, allowing for dynamic translation between individuals. The digoxin report demonstrates the level of confidence in the digoxin PBPK model with the OSP suite with regard to reliable predictions of digoxin PK in adults during model-informed drug development.
