The final digoxin PBPK model applies elimination mainly via GFR and P-gp and adequately describes the pharmacokinetics of digoxin in adults receiving intravenous, and oral SD and MD of digoxin ranging from 0.125 to 1.5 mg, for different types of tablet formulations that were described using a single formulation. 

This model could be applied for the investigation of drug-drug interactions (DDI), and translation to special populations such as pediatrics with regard to P-gp based elimination.
